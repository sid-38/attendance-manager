# attendance-manager
A rudimentary attendance management system for educational institutions built on PhP for an undergraduate project. Only key thing of interest was the all-nighter we had to pull to finish the project, as well as a string based encoding for storing the attendance data. A string would represent a student's attendance for one semester for one class. The string would be of the form "1.11.10.11.10.11.00.11" where each dot would represent the start of a new day and 1 would indicate the student was present while 0 would indicate his/her absence. It was mainly because in our campus, one student could have multiple sessions of the same class on the same day, and the schedule was not fixed.
